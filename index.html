                    <p><i><b><strong>Sporting</strong></b></i>  At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.<br> He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.<br>A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3–0 win.<br>Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.<br>Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.<br>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, however, determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.<br>Initially, United had just planned to sign Ronaldo and then loan him back to Sporting for a year.<br>Having impressed the Manchester United players, however, they urged Ferguson to sign him.<br>After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.<br>A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member
                    <p><i><b><strong>Manchester United</strong></b></i>  Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.<br>His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.<br>Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.<br>Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.<br>A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."
                    <p><i><b><strong>Real Madrid</strong></b></i>  Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).<br>His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.<br>At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.<br>Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7, the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United, Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.
                    <p><i><b><strong>Juventus</strong></b></i>  After a week of transfer speculation, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, plus solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs and an additional €12 million in other fees.<br>The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,and the highest ever paid by an Italian club.<br>Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Real Madrid.<br>Ronaldo made his official debut for Juventus in their opening Serie A match on 18 August, a 3–2 away win over Chievo.<br>On 16 September, his fourth appearance for Juventus, he scored his first goal, which was immediately followed by a second, in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo; the latter was the 400th league goal of his career.<br>On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct"—the first time in 154 Champions League appearances—in an eventual 2–0 away win over Valencia
